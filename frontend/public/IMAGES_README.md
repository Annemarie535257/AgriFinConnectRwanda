# Landing page images

For the best quality on screen, use **high-resolution** images in this folder.

**Currently used on the landing page:**

| File | Use | Recommended size |
|------|-----|------------------|
| `download (1).jpeg` | Hero (home) | **1920×1080** or larger; will be cropped to fit |
| `download (3).jpeg` | Our Services section (right side) | **800×600** or larger |
| `download (2).jpeg` | About section | **900×500** or larger |

**Tips:**
- Replace these files with higher-resolution versions (same names) to improve quality.
- Prefer **JPEG** at 80–90% quality, or **WebP** for smaller file size at similar quality.
- Avoid upscaling small images—they will look blurry. Start from at least the sizes above.
